      "description": "During the 2018-2019 school year, teacher Jessica Lander (EDM&#39;15) and students in her Seminar on American Diversity strove to answer the question: What does it mean to be American? In trying to tie together large historical movements and individual histories they wrote and edited two books of personal stories &quot;We Are America&quot; and &quot;We Are America Too.&quot; Their hope was to start a different type of conversation about identity. This summer, Lander and her students launched the national We Are America Project. This year they are working with 36 teachers and more than 1300 young people across the country to create a new definition of what it means to be American &#8212; and to spark a new national conversation about American identity today led by the next generation. Come see the students work and stories at the Gutman Gallery from Nov. 1 to Dec. 16.",
