## Notes for instructor

In completing the Week 4 assignment, I did some work converting my Week 2 High-Low game to a Vue version as I started going through the videos. However, since the Week 4 material goes over so much of the High-Low game in Vue, I decided it would be better to switch to a new game for Project 1. Therefore, I am switching my game to the **War** card game.
