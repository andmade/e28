## Notes for instructor

Since the Week 4 material goes over so much of the High-Low game in Vue, I decided it would be better to switch to a new game for Project 1. Therefore, I switched to the **War** card game with some modifications.

1. There is only 1 round.
2. Players can choose from a hand of 5 cards.
3. Scoring is such that:

- Diamonds beat Spades and Spades beat Hearts
- Hearts beat Clubs and Clubs beat Diamonds
- If two cards of the same color (i.e. Spades and Clubs, Hearts and Diamonds) are selected, the card with the highest number value wins. If the cards are the same value, it's a tie and neither side gains a point.
