      "featured": false,
      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

Robleto explores the profundity and confusion of this early moment, when ineffable emotional and sensory experiences first became visible as data. His multimedia installation, based on extensive archival research, reawakens the intimacy, beauty, and emotional complexity of these first waveforms drawn from and by the heart. Casting them in steel and brass, printing and retrieving them from new layers of soot, and converting them into video and engineered sound, Robleto encourages us to attend to them with resonant forms of empathy, to reflect upon the lives of the 19th-century subjects who bequeathed them to us &#8212; and ultimately to imagine more heartfelt ways of inheriting and interpreting historical data.",

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

His multimedia installation, based on extensive archival research, reawakens the intimacy, beauty, and emotional complexity of these first waveforms drawn from and by the heart. Casting them in steel and brass, printing and retrieving them from new layers of soot, and converting them into video and engineered sound, Robleto encourages us to attend to them with resonant forms of empathy, to reflect upon the lives of the 19th-century subjects who bequeathed them to us &#8212; and ultimately to imagine more heartfelt ways of inheriting and interpreting historical data.",

      "featured": false,
      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

Robleto explores the profundity and confusion of this early moment, when ineffable emotional and sensory experiences first became visible as data. His multimedia installation, based on extensive archival research, reawakens the intimacy, beauty, and emotional complexity of these first waveforms drawn from and by the heart. Casting them in steel and brass, printing and retrieving them from new layers of soot, and converting them into video and engineered sound, Robleto encourages us to attend to them with resonant forms of empathy, to reflect upon the lives of the 19th-century subjects who bequeathed them to us &#8212; and ultimately to imagine more heartfelt ways of inheriting and interpreting historical data.",

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

Robleto explores the profundity and confusion of this early moment, when ineffable emotional and sensory experiences first became visible as data. His multimedia installation, based on extensive archival research, reawakens the intimacy, beauty, and emotional complexity of these first waveforms drawn from and by the heart. Casting them in steel and brass, printing and retrieving them from new layers of soot, and converting them into video and engineered sound, Robleto encourages us to attend to them with resonant forms of empathy, to reflect upon the lives of the 19th-century subjects who bequeathed them to us &#8212; and ultimately to imagine more heartfelt ways of inheriting and interpreting historical data.",

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

Robleto explores the profundity and confusion of this early moment, when ineffable emotional and sensory experiences first became visible as data. His multimedia installation, based on extensive archival research, reawakens the intimacy, beauty, and emotional complexity of these first waveforms drawn from and by the heart. Casting them in steel and brass, printing and retrieving them from new layers of soot, and converting them into video and engineered sound, Robleto encourages us to attend to them with resonant forms of empathy, to reflect upon the lives of the 19th-century subjects who bequeathed them to us &#8212; and ultimately to imagine more heartfelt ways of inheriting and interpreting historical data.",

In the gallery, works are grouped around the following themes: Reversal, Pressure, Color Separation, Depth, and Replicability.<br /> <br /> Over 20 prints are featured, including works by the following artists: Otto Dix, Helen Frankenthaler, Jesse Aron Green, Jasper Johns, Corita Kent, Jackson Pollock, Robert Rauschenberg, May Stevens, Utagawa Hiroshige, Edouard Vuillard, and John Wilson. Also included are examples of Notgeld, emergency currency printed in Weimar Germany around 1920.",

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

      "description": "&quot;Critical Printing&quot; is an experimental course offered by Harvard&#8217;s Department of Art, Film, and Visual Studies that integrates studio and seminar instruction, allowing students to explore print as artists and scholars simultaneously. In this installation, as in the course, prints are organized not by medium or chronology, but by fundamental modes of critical thinking that emerge from the printmaking process. In the gallery, works are grouped around the following themes: Reversal, Pressure, Color Separation, Depth, and Replicability.<br /> <br /> Over 20 prints are featured, including works by the following artists: Otto Dix, Helen Frankenthaler, Jesse Aron Green, Jasper Johns, Corita Kent, Jackson Pollock, Robert Rauschenberg, May Stevens, Utagawa Hiroshige, Edouard Vuillard, and John Wilson. Also included are examples of Notgeld, emergency currency printed in Weimar Germany around 1920.",

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

Robleto explores the profundity and confusion of this early moment, when ineffable emotional and sensory experiences first became visible as data. His multimedia installation, based on extensive archival research, reawakens the intimacy, beauty, and emotional complexity of these first waveforms drawn from and by the heart. Casting them in steel and brass, printing and retrieving them from new layers of soot, and converting them into video and engineered sound, Robleto encourages us to attend to them with resonant forms of empathy, to reflect upon the lives of the 19th-century subjects who bequeathed them to us &#8212; and ultimately to imagine more heartfelt ways of inheriting and interpreting historical data.",

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

Robleto explores the profundity and confusion of this early moment, when ineffable emotional and sensory experiences first became visible as data. His multimedia installation, based on extensive archival research, reawakens the intimacy, beauty, and emotional complexity of these first waveforms drawn from and by the heart. Casting them in steel and brass, printing and retrieving them from new layers of soot, and converting them into video and engineered sound, Robleto encourages us to attend to them with resonant forms of empathy, to reflect upon the lives of the 19th-century subjects who bequeathed them to us &#8212; and ultimately to imagine more heartfelt ways of inheriting and interpreting historical data.",

In this installation, as in the course, prints are organized not by medium or chronology, but by fundamental modes of critical thinking that emerge from the printmaking process. In the gallery, works are grouped around the following themes: Reversal, Pressure, Color Separation, Depth, and Replicability.<br /> <br /> Over 20 prints are featured, including works by the following artists: Otto Dix, Helen Frankenthaler, Jesse Aron Green, Jasper Johns, Corita Kent, Jackson Pollock, Robert Rauschenberg, May Stevens, Utagawa Hiroshige, Edouard Vuillard, and John Wilson. Also included are examples of Notgeld, emergency currency printed in Weimar Germany around 1920.",

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

Robleto explores the profundity and confusion of this early moment, when ineffable emotional and sensory experiences first became visible as data. His multimedia installation, based on extensive archival research, reawakens the intimacy, beauty, and emotional complexity of these first waveforms drawn from and by the heart. Casting them in steel and brass, printing and retrieving them from new layers of soot, and converting them into video and engineered sound, Robleto encourages us to attend to them with resonant forms of empathy, to reflect upon the lives of the 19th-century subjects who bequeathed them to us &#8212; and ultimately to imagine more heartfelt ways of inheriting and interpreting historical data.",

The exhibit documents her extraordinary five-year journey through the contested borderlands of the Caspian Sea, and reveals the essential role played by elemental materials like oil, rock, and uranium in the practical, artistic, spiritual, and therapeutic aspects of daily life. Caspian: The Elements is a powerful photographic narrative that explores the deep links between the peoples of the Caspian and their enigmatic and coveted landscapes. The exhibition will remain on view through Feb. 17, 2020.<br /> <br /> See exhibition-related lecture by Chloe Dewe Mathews on April 25, 2019: <a href=\"https://www.peabody.harvard.edu/caspian-the-elements-preview-and-lecture\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.peabody.harvard.edu/caspian-the-elements-preview-and-lecture\">www.peabody.harvard.edu&#8230;</a>",

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

      "description": "Artist Dario Robleto&#8217;s exhibition examines the 19th-century origins of the pulse wave as a graphic expression of internal life. Robleto explores the profundity and confusion of this early moment, when ineffable emotional and sensory experiences first became visible as data. His multimedia installation, based on extensive archival research, reawakens the intimacy, beauty, and emotional complexity of these first waveforms drawn from and by the heart. Casting them in steel and brass, printing and retrieving them from new layers of soot, and converting them into video and engineered sound, Robleto encourages us to attend to them with resonant forms of empathy, to reflect upon the lives of the 19th-century subjects who bequeathed them to us &#8212; and ultimately to imagine more heartfelt ways of inheriting and interpreting historical data.",

Join the Harvard Museum of Natural History in celebrating this invaluable gift with a visit to The Rockefeller Beetles &#8212; a new exhibit that features hundreds of specimens from Rockefeller&#8217;s collection and recounts the story of a man whose childhood pursuit grew into a lifelong passion.",

If we wait too long, the activity of fungi, bacteria, and other microbes will soon appear as an unexpected blotch, suspicious &#8220;fuzz,&#8221; or oddly curled foliage.<br /> <br /> Fruits in Decay is a new special exhibit in the Glass Flowers gallery that explores blight, rot, and other diseases on summer fruits. It features exquisitely detailed glass botanical models of strawberries, peaches, apricots, plums, and pears made by famed glass artist Rudolf Blaschka. On display for the first time in nearly two decades, these models capture &#8212; with astonishing realism &#8212; the intricacies and strange beauty of fruits in various stages of decay.",

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

His multimedia installation, based on extensive archival research, reawakens the intimacy, beauty, and emotional complexity of these first waveforms drawn from and by the heart. Casting them in steel and brass, printing and retrieving them from new layers of soot, and converting them into video and engineered sound, Robleto encourages us to attend to them with resonant forms of empathy, to reflect upon the lives of the 19th-century subjects who bequeathed them to us &#8212; and ultimately to imagine more heartfelt ways of inheriting and interpreting historical data.",

In this installation, as in the course, prints are organized not by medium or chronology, but by fundamental modes of critical thinking that emerge from the printmaking process. In the gallery, works are grouped around the following themes: Reversal, Pressure, Color Separation, Depth, and Replicability.<br /> <br /> Over 20 prints are featured, including works by the following artists: Otto Dix, Helen Frankenthaler, Jesse Aron Green, Jasper Johns, Corita Kent, Jackson Pollock, Robert Rauschenberg, May Stevens, Utagawa Hiroshige, Edouard Vuillard, and John Wilson. Also included are examples of Notgeld, emergency currency printed in Weimar Germany around 1920.",

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

Robleto explores the profundity and confusion of this early moment, when ineffable emotional and sensory experiences first became visible as data. His multimedia installation, based on extensive archival research, reawakens the intimacy, beauty, and emotional complexity of these first waveforms drawn from and by the heart. Casting them in steel and brass, printing and retrieving them from new layers of soot, and converting them into video and engineered sound, Robleto encourages us to attend to them with resonant forms of empathy, to reflect upon the lives of the 19th-century subjects who bequeathed them to us &#8212; and ultimately to imagine more heartfelt ways of inheriting and interpreting historical data.",

      "featured": false,
      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

If we wait too long, the activity of fungi, bacteria, and other microbes will soon appear as an unexpected blotch, suspicious &#8220;fuzz,&#8221; or oddly curled foliage.<br /> <br /> Fruits in Decay is a new special exhibit in the Glass Flowers gallery that explores blight, rot, and other diseases on summer fruits. It features exquisitely detailed glass botanical models of strawberries, peaches, apricots, plums, and pears made by famed glass artist Rudolf Blaschka. On display for the first time in nearly two decades, these models capture &#8212; with astonishing realism &#8212; the intricacies and strange beauty of fruits in various stages of decay.",

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

His multimedia installation, based on extensive archival research, reawakens the intimacy, beauty, and emotional complexity of these first waveforms drawn from and by the heart. Casting them in steel and brass, printing and retrieving them from new layers of soot, and converting them into video and engineered sound, Robleto encourages us to attend to them with resonant forms of empathy, to reflect upon the lives of the 19th-century subjects who bequeathed them to us &#8212; and ultimately to imagine more heartfelt ways of inheriting and interpreting historical data.",

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

Robleto explores the profundity and confusion of this early moment, when ineffable emotional and sensory experiences first became visible as data. His multimedia installation, based on extensive archival research, reawakens the intimacy, beauty, and emotional complexity of these first waveforms drawn from and by the heart. Casting them in steel and brass, printing and retrieving them from new layers of soot, and converting them into video and engineered sound, Robleto encourages us to attend to them with resonant forms of empathy, to reflect upon the lives of the 19th-century subjects who bequeathed them to us &#8212; and ultimately to imagine more heartfelt ways of inheriting and interpreting historical data.",

      "description": "&quot;Caspian: The Elements&quot; is a new exhibit featuring the evocative imagery of Chloe Dewe Mathews, the 2014 recipient of the Peabody Museum&#8217;s Robert Gardner Fellowship in Photography. The exhibit documents her extraordinary five-year journey through the contested borderlands of the Caspian Sea, and reveals the essential role played by elemental materials like oil, rock, and uranium in the practical, artistic, spiritual, and therapeutic aspects of daily life. Caspian: The Elements is a powerful photographic narrative that explores the deep links between the peoples of the Caspian and their enigmatic and coveted landscapes. The exhibition will remain on view through Feb. 17, 2020.<br /> <br /> See exhibition-related lecture by Chloe Dewe Mathews on April 25, 2019: <a href=\"https://www.peabody.harvard.edu/caspian-the-elements-preview-and-lecture\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.peabody.harvard.edu/caspian-the-elements-preview-and-lecture\">www.peabody.harvard.edu&#8230;</a>",

If we wait too long, the activity of fungi, bacteria, and other microbes will soon appear as an unexpected blotch, suspicious &#8220;fuzz,&#8221; or oddly curled foliage.<br /> <br /> Fruits in Decay is a new special exhibit in the Glass Flowers gallery that explores blight, rot, and other diseases on summer fruits. It features exquisitely detailed glass botanical models of strawberries, peaches, apricots, plums, and pears made by famed glass artist Rudolf Blaschka. On display for the first time in nearly two decades, these models capture &#8212; with astonishing realism &#8212; the intricacies and strange beauty of fruits in various stages of decay.",

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

His multimedia installation, based on extensive archival research, reawakens the intimacy, beauty, and emotional complexity of these first waveforms drawn from and by the heart. Casting them in steel and brass, printing and retrieving them from new layers of soot, and converting them into video and engineered sound, Robleto encourages us to attend to them with resonant forms of empathy, to reflect upon the lives of the 19th-century subjects who bequeathed them to us &#8212; and ultimately to imagine more heartfelt ways of inheriting and interpreting historical data.",

      "featured": false,
      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

Robleto explores the profundity and confusion of this early moment, when ineffable emotional and sensory experiences first became visible as data. His multimedia installation, based on extensive archival research, reawakens the intimacy, beauty, and emotional complexity of these first waveforms drawn from and by the heart. Casting them in steel and brass, printing and retrieving them from new layers of soot, and converting them into video and engineered sound, Robleto encourages us to attend to them with resonant forms of empathy, to reflect upon the lives of the 19th-century subjects who bequeathed them to us &#8212; and ultimately to imagine more heartfelt ways of inheriting and interpreting historical data.",

Ultimately, he produced a series of 87 photographs, now held at the Harvard University Archives, that visually document Harvard in a period of unprecedented growth and change.<br /> <br /> On exhibit are 11 original gelatin silver prints of Rittase&#39;s 1932 Harvard photographs as well as several reproductions, all placed in their historical, technological, and artistic context. Come see how Harvard was changing in the early &#39;30s, and investigate how it has changed since.",

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

His multimedia installation, based on extensive archival research, reawakens the intimacy, beauty, and emotional complexity of these first waveforms drawn from and by the heart. Casting them in steel and brass, printing and retrieving them from new layers of soot, and converting them into video and engineered sound, Robleto encourages us to attend to them with resonant forms of empathy, to reflect upon the lives of the 19th-century subjects who bequeathed them to us &#8212; and ultimately to imagine more heartfelt ways of inheriting and interpreting historical data.",

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

Robleto explores the profundity and confusion of this early moment, when ineffable emotional and sensory experiences first became visible as data. His multimedia installation, based on extensive archival research, reawakens the intimacy, beauty, and emotional complexity of these first waveforms drawn from and by the heart. Casting them in steel and brass, printing and retrieving them from new layers of soot, and converting them into video and engineered sound, Robleto encourages us to attend to them with resonant forms of empathy, to reflect upon the lives of the 19th-century subjects who bequeathed them to us &#8212; and ultimately to imagine more heartfelt ways of inheriting and interpreting historical data.",

      "featured": false,
      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

      "description": "In the fall of 1932, Harvard invited William Rittase (1894-1968), a Philadelphia-based photographer, to Cambridge to capture views of Harvard Yard, its buildings, and the greater campus beyond its gates. Ultimately, he produced a series of 87 photographs, now held at the Harvard University Archives, that visually document Harvard in a period of unprecedented growth and change.<br /> <br /> On exhibit are 11 original gelatin silver prints of Rittase&#39;s 1932 Harvard photographs as well as several reproductions, all placed in their historical, technological, and artistic context. Come see how Harvard was changing in the early &#39;30s, and investigate how it has changed since.",

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

Robleto explores the profundity and confusion of this early moment, when ineffable emotional and sensory experiences first became visible as data. His multimedia installation, based on extensive archival research, reawakens the intimacy, beauty, and emotional complexity of these first waveforms drawn from and by the heart. Casting them in steel and brass, printing and retrieving them from new layers of soot, and converting them into video and engineered sound, Robleto encourages us to attend to them with resonant forms of empathy, to reflect upon the lives of the 19th-century subjects who bequeathed them to us &#8212; and ultimately to imagine more heartfelt ways of inheriting and interpreting historical data.",

      "description": "In the fall of 1932, Harvard invited William Rittase (1894-1968), a Philadelphia-based photographer, to Cambridge to capture views of Harvard Yard, its buildings, and the greater campus beyond its gates. Ultimately, he produced a series of 87 photographs, now held at the Harvard University Archives, that visually document Harvard in a period of unprecedented growth and change.<br /> <br /> On exhibit are 11 original gelatin silver prints of Rittase&#39;s 1932 Harvard photographs as well as several reproductions, all placed in their historical, technological, and artistic context. Come see how Harvard was changing in the early &#39;30s, and investigate how it has changed since.",

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

Robleto explores the profundity and confusion of this early moment, when ineffable emotional and sensory experiences first became visible as data. His multimedia installation, based on extensive archival research, reawakens the intimacy, beauty, and emotional complexity of these first waveforms drawn from and by the heart. Casting them in steel and brass, printing and retrieving them from new layers of soot, and converting them into video and engineered sound, Robleto encourages us to attend to them with resonant forms of empathy, to reflect upon the lives of the 19th-century subjects who bequeathed them to us &#8212; and ultimately to imagine more heartfelt ways of inheriting and interpreting historical data.",

      "description": "In the fall of 1932, Harvard invited William Rittase (1894-1968), a Philadelphia-based photographer, to Cambridge to capture views of Harvard Yard, its buildings, and the greater campus beyond its gates. Ultimately, he produced a series of 87 photographs, now held at the Harvard University Archives, that visually document Harvard in a period of unprecedented growth and change.<br /> <br /> On exhibit are 11 original gelatin silver prints of Rittase&#39;s 1932 Harvard photographs as well as several reproductions, all placed in their historical, technological, and artistic context. Come see how Harvard was changing in the early &#39;30s, and investigate how it has changed since.",

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

Robleto explores the profundity and confusion of this early moment, when ineffable emotional and sensory experiences first became visible as data. His multimedia installation, based on extensive archival research, reawakens the intimacy, beauty, and emotional complexity of these first waveforms drawn from and by the heart. Casting them in steel and brass, printing and retrieving them from new layers of soot, and converting them into video and engineered sound, Robleto encourages us to attend to them with resonant forms of empathy, to reflect upon the lives of the 19th-century subjects who bequeathed them to us &#8212; and ultimately to imagine more heartfelt ways of inheriting and interpreting historical data.",

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

Robleto explores the profundity and confusion of this early moment, when ineffable emotional and sensory experiences first became visible as data. His multimedia installation, based on extensive archival research, reawakens the intimacy, beauty, and emotional complexity of these first waveforms drawn from and by the heart. Casting them in steel and brass, printing and retrieving them from new layers of soot, and converting them into video and engineered sound, Robleto encourages us to attend to them with resonant forms of empathy, to reflect upon the lives of the 19th-century subjects who bequeathed them to us &#8212; and ultimately to imagine more heartfelt ways of inheriting and interpreting historical data.",

      "description": "Saturday, Aug. 31, 2019 &#8211; Sunday, March 1, 2020<br /> <br /> While we eagerly await the ripening of our favorite summer fruits, microscopic competitors are at work multiplying and consuming them in a world beyond our sight. If we wait too long, the activity of fungi, bacteria, and other microbes will soon appear as an unexpected blotch, suspicious &#8220;fuzz,&#8221; or oddly curled foliage.<br /> <br /> Fruits in Decay is a new special exhibit in the Glass Flowers gallery that explores blight, rot, and other diseases on summer fruits. It features exquisitely detailed glass botanical models of strawberries, peaches, apricots, plums, and pears made by famed glass artist Rudolf Blaschka. On display for the first time in nearly two decades, these models capture &#8212; with astonishing realism &#8212; the intricacies and strange beauty of fruits in various stages of decay.",

      "featured": false,
      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

Robleto explores the profundity and confusion of this early moment, when ineffable emotional and sensory experiences first became visible as data. His multimedia installation, based on extensive archival research, reawakens the intimacy, beauty, and emotional complexity of these first waveforms drawn from and by the heart. Casting them in steel and brass, printing and retrieving them from new layers of soot, and converting them into video and engineered sound, Robleto encourages us to attend to them with resonant forms of empathy, to reflect upon the lives of the 19th-century subjects who bequeathed them to us &#8212; and ultimately to imagine more heartfelt ways of inheriting and interpreting historical data.",

If we wait too long, the activity of fungi, bacteria, and other microbes will soon appear as an unexpected blotch, suspicious &#8220;fuzz,&#8221; or oddly curled foliage.<br /> <br /> Fruits in Decay is a new special exhibit in the Glass Flowers gallery that explores blight, rot, and other diseases on summer fruits. It features exquisitely detailed glass botanical models of strawberries, peaches, apricots, plums, and pears made by famed glass artist Rudolf Blaschka. On display for the first time in nearly two decades, these models capture &#8212; with astonishing realism &#8212; the intricacies and strange beauty of fruits in various stages of decay.",

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

Robleto explores the profundity and confusion of this early moment, when ineffable emotional and sensory experiences first became visible as data. His multimedia installation, based on extensive archival research, reawakens the intimacy, beauty, and emotional complexity of these first waveforms drawn from and by the heart. Casting them in steel and brass, printing and retrieving them from new layers of soot, and converting them into video and engineered sound, Robleto encourages us to attend to them with resonant forms of empathy, to reflect upon the lives of the 19th-century subjects who bequeathed them to us &#8212; and ultimately to imagine more heartfelt ways of inheriting and interpreting historical data.",

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

Robleto explores the profundity and confusion of this early moment, when ineffable emotional and sensory experiences first became visible as data. His multimedia installation, based on extensive archival research, reawakens the intimacy, beauty, and emotional complexity of these first waveforms drawn from and by the heart. Casting them in steel and brass, printing and retrieving them from new layers of soot, and converting them into video and engineered sound, Robleto encourages us to attend to them with resonant forms of empathy, to reflect upon the lives of the 19th-century subjects who bequeathed them to us &#8212; and ultimately to imagine more heartfelt ways of inheriting and interpreting historical data.",

      "description": "In the fall of 1932, Harvard invited William Rittase (1894-1968), a Philadelphia-based photographer, to Cambridge to capture views of Harvard Yard, its buildings, and the greater campus beyond its gates. Ultimately, he produced a series of 87 photographs, now held at the Harvard University Archives, that visually document Harvard in a period of unprecedented growth and change.<br /> <br /> On exhibit are 11 original gelatin silver prints of Rittase&#39;s 1932 Harvard photographs as well as several reproductions, all placed in their historical, technological, and artistic context. Come see how Harvard was changing in the early &#39;30s, and investigate how it has changed since.",

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

Robleto explores the profundity and confusion of this early moment, when ineffable emotional and sensory experiences first became visible as data. His multimedia installation, based on extensive archival research, reawakens the intimacy, beauty, and emotional complexity of these first waveforms drawn from and by the heart. Casting them in steel and brass, printing and retrieving them from new layers of soot, and converting them into video and engineered sound, Robleto encourages us to attend to them with resonant forms of empathy, to reflect upon the lives of the 19th-century subjects who bequeathed them to us &#8212; and ultimately to imagine more heartfelt ways of inheriting and interpreting historical data.",

      "description": "In the fall of 1932, Harvard invited William Rittase (1894-1968), a Philadelphia-based photographer, to Cambridge to capture views of Harvard Yard, its buildings, and the greater campus beyond its gates. Ultimately, he produced a series of 87 photographs, now held at the Harvard University Archives, that visually document Harvard in a period of unprecedented growth and change.<br /> <br /> On exhibit are 11 original gelatin silver prints of Rittase&#39;s 1932 Harvard photographs as well as several reproductions, all placed in their historical, technological, and artistic context. Come see how Harvard was changing in the early &#39;30s, and investigate how it has changed since.",

      "featured": false,
      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

Robleto explores the profundity and confusion of this early moment, when ineffable emotional and sensory experiences first became visible as data. His multimedia installation, based on extensive archival research, reawakens the intimacy, beauty, and emotional complexity of these first waveforms drawn from and by the heart. Casting them in steel and brass, printing and retrieving them from new layers of soot, and converting them into video and engineered sound, Robleto encourages us to attend to them with resonant forms of empathy, to reflect upon the lives of the 19th-century subjects who bequeathed them to us &#8212; and ultimately to imagine more heartfelt ways of inheriting and interpreting historical data.",

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

Robleto explores the profundity and confusion of this early moment, when ineffable emotional and sensory experiences first became visible as data. His multimedia installation, based on extensive archival research, reawakens the intimacy, beauty, and emotional complexity of these first waveforms drawn from and by the heart. Casting them in steel and brass, printing and retrieving them from new layers of soot, and converting them into video and engineered sound, Robleto encourages us to attend to them with resonant forms of empathy, to reflect upon the lives of the 19th-century subjects who bequeathed them to us &#8212; and ultimately to imagine more heartfelt ways of inheriting and interpreting historical data.",

Robleto explores the profundity and confusion of this early moment, when ineffable emotional and sensory experiences first became visible as data. His multimedia installation, based on extensive archival research, reawakens the intimacy, beauty, and emotional complexity of these first waveforms drawn from and by the heart. Casting them in steel and brass, printing and retrieving them from new layers of soot, and converting them into video and engineered sound, Robleto encourages us to attend to them with resonant forms of empathy, to reflect upon the lives of the 19th-century subjects who bequeathed them to us &#8212; and ultimately to imagine more heartfelt ways of inheriting and interpreting historical data.",

      "description": "Artist Dario Robleto&#8217;s exhibition examines the 19th-century origins of the pulse wave as a graphic expression of internal life. Robleto explores the profundity and confusion of this early moment, when ineffable emotional and sensory experiences first became visible as data. His multimedia installation, based on extensive archival research, reawakens the intimacy, beauty, and emotional complexity of these first waveforms drawn from and by the heart. Casting them in steel and brass, printing and retrieving them from new layers of soot, and converting them into video and engineered sound, Robleto encourages us to attend to them with resonant forms of empathy, to reflect upon the lives of the 19th-century subjects who bequeathed them to us &#8212; and ultimately to imagine more heartfelt ways of inheriting and interpreting historical data.",

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied.

      "featured": false,
      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

If we wait too long, the activity of fungi, bacteria, and other microbes will soon appear as an unexpected blotch, suspicious &#8220;fuzz,&#8221; or oddly curled foliage.<br /> <br /> Fruits in Decay is a new special exhibit in the Glass Flowers gallery that explores blight, rot, and other diseases on summer fruits. It features exquisitely detailed glass botanical models of strawberries, peaches, apricots, plums, and pears made by famed glass artist Rudolf Blaschka. On display for the first time in nearly two decades, these models capture &#8212; with astonishing realism &#8212; the intricacies and strange beauty of fruits in various stages of decay.",

If we wait too long, the activity of fungi, bacteria, and other microbes will soon appear as an unexpected blotch, suspicious &#8220;fuzz,&#8221; or oddly curled foliage.<br /> <br /> Fruits in Decay is a new special exhibit in the Glass Flowers gallery that explores blight, rot, and other diseases on summer fruits. It features exquisitely detailed glass botanical models of strawberries, peaches, apricots, plums, and pears made by famed glass artist Rudolf Blaschka. On display for the first time in nearly two decades, these models capture &#8212; with astonishing realism &#8212; the intricacies and strange beauty of fruits in various stages of decay.",

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

It features exquisitely detailed glass botanical models of strawberries, peaches, apricots, plums, and pears made by famed glass artist Rudolf Blaschka.

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

Torn between their own ambitions and the omnipresent demands of the state, each walks an individual path of compromise. Some muster cunning and cynicism to extract all manner of benefits and privileges from those in power. Others, finding themselves to be less adept, are left broken and demoralized. What binds them together is the tangled web of dilemmas and contradictions they face.",

If we wait too long, the activity of fungi, bacteria, and other microbes will soon appear as an unexpected blotch, suspicious &#8220;fuzz,&#8221; or oddly curled foliage.<br /> <br /> Fruits in Decay is a new special exhibit in the Glass Flowers gallery that explores blight, rot, and other diseases on summer fruits. It features exquisitely detailed glass botanical models of strawberries, peaches, apricots, plums, and pears made by famed glass artist Rudolf Blaschka. On display for the first time in nearly two decades, these models capture &#8212; with astonishing realism &#8212; the intricacies and strange beauty of fruits in various stages of decay.",

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied.

If we wait too long, the activity of fungi, bacteria, and other microbes will soon appear as an unexpected blotch, suspicious &#8220;fuzz,&#8221; or oddly curled foliage.<br /> <br /> Fruits in Decay is a new special exhibit in the Glass Flowers gallery that explores blight, rot, and other diseases on summer fruits. It features exquisitely detailed glass botanical models of strawberries, peaches, apricots, plums, and pears made by famed glass artist Rudolf Blaschka. On display for the first time in nearly two decades, these models capture &#8212; with astonishing realism &#8212; the intricacies and strange beauty of fruits in various stages of decay.",

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

It features exquisitely detailed glass botanical models of strawberries, peaches, apricots, plums, and pears made by famed glass artist Rudolf Blaschka.

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

If we wait too long, the activity of fungi, bacteria, and other microbes will soon appear as an unexpected blotch, suspicious &#8220;fuzz,&#8221; or oddly curled foliage.<br /> <br /> Fruits in Decay is a new special exhibit in the Glass Flowers gallery that explores blight, rot, and other diseases on summer fruits. It features exquisitely detailed glass botanical models of strawberries, peaches, apricots, plums, and pears made by famed glass artist Rudolf Blaschka.

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

If we wait too long, the activity of fungi, bacteria, and other microbes will soon appear as an unexpected blotch, suspicious &#8220;fuzz,&#8221; or oddly curled foliage.<br /> <br /> Fruits in Decay is a new special exhibit in the Glass Flowers gallery that explores blight, rot, and other diseases on summer fruits. It features exquisitely detailed glass botanical models of strawberries, peaches, apricots, plums, and pears made by famed glass artist Rudolf Blaschka. On display for the first time in nearly two decades, these models capture &#8212; with astonishing realism &#8212; the intricacies and strange beauty of fruits in various stages of decay.",

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied.

If we wait too long, the activity of fungi, bacteria, and other microbes will soon appear as an unexpected blotch, suspicious &#8220;fuzz,&#8221; or oddly curled foliage.<br /> <br /> Fruits in Decay is a new special exhibit in the Glass Flowers gallery that explores blight, rot, and other diseases on summer fruits. It features exquisitely detailed glass botanical models of strawberries, peaches, apricots, plums, and pears made by famed glass artist Rudolf Blaschka. On display for the first time in nearly two decades, these models capture &#8212; with astonishing realism &#8212; the intricacies and strange beauty of fruits in various stages of decay.",

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

If we wait too long, the activity of fungi, bacteria, and other microbes will soon appear as an unexpected blotch, suspicious &#8220;fuzz,&#8221; or oddly curled foliage.<br /> <br /> Fruits in Decay is a new special exhibit in the Glass Flowers gallery that explores blight, rot, and other diseases on summer fruits. It features exquisitely detailed glass botanical models of strawberries, peaches, apricots, plums, and pears made by famed glass artist Rudolf Blaschka.

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

If we wait too long, the activity of fungi, bacteria, and other microbes will soon appear as an unexpected blotch, suspicious &#8220;fuzz,&#8221; or oddly curled foliage.<br /> <br /> Fruits in Decay is a new special exhibit in the Glass Flowers gallery that explores blight, rot, and other diseases on summer fruits. It features exquisitely detailed glass botanical models of strawberries, peaches, apricots, plums, and pears made by famed glass artist Rudolf Blaschka. On display for the first time in nearly two decades, these models capture &#8212; with astonishing realism &#8212; the intricacies and strange beauty of fruits in various stages of decay.",

      "featured": false,
      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

      "featured": false,
      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

Images have played many roles in scientific research.

They can also make unseen things visible.

It features exquisitely detailed glass botanical models of strawberries, peaches, apricots, plums, and pears made by famed glass artist Rudolf Blaschka. On display for the first time in nearly two decades, these models capture &#8212; with astonishing realism &#8212; the intricacies and strange beauty of fruits in various stages of decay.",

      "featured": false,
      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

It features exquisitely detailed glass botanical models of strawberries, peaches, apricots, plums, and pears made by famed glass artist Rudolf Blaschka. On display for the first time in nearly two decades, these models capture &#8212; with astonishing realism &#8212; the intricacies and strange beauty of fruits in various stages of decay.",

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

If we wait too long, the activity of fungi, bacteria, and other microbes will soon appear as an unexpected blotch, suspicious &#8220;fuzz,&#8221; or oddly curled foliage.<br /> <br /> Fruits in Decay is a new special exhibit in the Glass Flowers gallery that explores blight, rot, and other diseases on summer fruits. It features exquisitely detailed glass botanical models of strawberries, peaches, apricots, plums, and pears made by famed glass artist Rudolf Blaschka. On display for the first time in nearly two decades, these models capture &#8212; with astonishing realism &#8212; the intricacies and strange beauty of fruits in various stages of decay.",

If we wait too long, the activity of fungi, bacteria, and other microbes will soon appear as an unexpected blotch, suspicious &#8220;fuzz,&#8221; or oddly curled foliage.<br /> <br /> Fruits in Decay is a new special exhibit in the Glass Flowers gallery that explores blight, rot, and other diseases on summer fruits. It features exquisitely detailed glass botanical models of strawberries, peaches, apricots, plums, and pears made by famed glass artist Rudolf Blaschka. On display for the first time in nearly two decades, these models capture &#8212; with astonishing realism &#8212; the intricacies and strange beauty of fruits in various stages of decay.",

      "featured": false,
      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied.

The full <a href=\"https://scholar.harvard.edu/ousmanekane/2019-2020-academic-year\" target=\"_blank\">lecture series schedule</a> can be found online.<br /> <br /> <strong>Islam in Africa Lecture Series: Critical Perspectives on the Development and Dynamics of Islam in Africa</strong><br /> <br /> Islam in Africa has become an important and increasingly vibrant sub-field in Islamic Studies, attracting numerous extremely talented students who are conducting fine studies that have great impact in all fields in the humanities and social sciences. Dozens of books are published yearly including through major university presses, and so the goal of Critical Perspectives in the Development and Dynamics of Islam in Africa lecture series is to provide a platform for the discussion of cutting edge research in the field of Islam in Africa and to tap into the best of such new work for Africanists and Islamicists at all schools at Harvard. Every academic year, the Islam in Africa lecture series brings authors of newly published books and advanced PhD students to campus to discuss their work.",

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

      "featured": false,
      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images.

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image.

      "description": "This exhibit features images and objects drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods that show the importance of visual experiences in science. Images have played many roles in scientific research. Images can record fleeting observations, whether a painting of an animal glimpsed in the field or an interaction between sub-atomic particles that lasts a millisecond. They can also make unseen things visible. Physical models can make abstract mathematical concepts into something that researchers can touch; properly arranged, sand, metal plates, and a violin bow can make sound waves into images. Finding patterns in both kinds of images, or painstakingly transforming images into data can lead to new discoveries.<br /> <br /> Images also play a role in summarizing, clarifying, and communicating ideas. Compelling images have often helped people understand and accept radically new ideas, turning what might at first be a hard to understand into a new commonsense understanding. Other times, visual representations can help students develop intuitions about their subject, whether about the structure of crystals or the stages of an embryo&#8217;s development. Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",

Images can also communicate complex and layered information, such as the complete design of a steam engine, in a compact and portable format.<br /> <br /> Looking closely at the use of images highlights the skills needed to create and interpret images. Scientists have often worked hand-in-hand with artists, sculptors, painters, and photographers. In doing so they make technical and aesthetic choices that shape the final image. Images can reveal as much about those who made them as they do about the phenomena being studied. Images can also be hard to interpret, with successful researchers developing a knack for recognizing important details and patterns.<br /> <br /> With large scale reproduction images, three dimensional objects, and films, this exhibit offers visitors a sampling of this rich topic.",
